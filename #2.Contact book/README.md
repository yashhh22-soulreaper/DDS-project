📖 Contact Book Project

📌 Overview

The **Contact Book Project** is a simple Python-based program that allows users to store, manage, and search their contacts. Each contact contains details such as **name, phone number, email, and address**. The program provides a **menu-driven CLI (Command Line Interface)** where users can add, view, search, update, or delete contacts.

This project is designed for **beginners in Python** to practice working with:

* Lists/Dictionaries or files for storing data
* CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* User input handling

---
⚙️ Tools Used

* **Python 3.x** → Core programming language
* **File Handling (optional)** → To save contacts permanently in a text/CSV/JSON file
* **Command Line Interface (CLI)** → For user interaction

*(You can also use SQLite if you want a database-backed version, but for a basic project, file storage or just in-memory lists are enough.)*
